## Development Guidelines

### Adding New Mobile Components

1. Create component in `/responsive/components/`

3. Export from `/responsive/index.ts`
4. Use `useMobile()` hook for responsive behavior

### CSS Classes Available

- `.touch-manipulation` - Touch-friendly interactions
- `.mobile-scroll` - Optimized scrolling
- `.mobile-button` - 44px+ touch targets
- `.mobile-input` - Zoom-prevention inputs
- `.mobile-carousel` - Touch carousels

### Media Query Breakpoints

- Mobile: `< 768px`
- Tablet: `768px - 1024px`
- Desktop: `> 1024px`

## Testing

Test on actual devices or use browser dev tools:

1. **iPhone SE** (375px) - Smallest mobile screen
2. **iPhone 12** (390px) - Standard mobile
3. **iPad** (768px) - Tablet breakpoint
4. **Landscape mode** - Orientation changes

## Next Steps

To extend mobile functionality:

1. Add more swipe gestures to product carousels
2. Implement pull-to-refresh on product lists
3. Add mobile-specific loading states
4. Integrate push notifications for cart reminders
5. Add mobile-specific animations and microinteractions

The responsive system is fully integrated and ready for production use with a native mobile feel that matches modern app experiences.
